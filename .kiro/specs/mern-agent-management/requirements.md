# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a MERN stack application for managing agents and distributing CSV-based task lists. The system provides admin authentication, agent management capabilities, and automated distribution of uploaded data among registered agents. The application ensures secure access through JWT authentication and maintains data integrity through proper validation and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to securely log into the system using my email and password, so that I can access the agent management dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin enters valid email and password THEN the system SHALL authenticate against MongoDB user data
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL generate a JWT token and redirect to dashboard
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN a user accesses protected routes without valid JWT THEN the system SHALL redirect to login page
5. IF the login form is submitted with empty fields THEN the system SHALL display validation errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to create and manage agents in the system, so that I can maintain a roster of available agents for task distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new agent THEN the system SHALL require name, email, mobile number with country code, and password
2. WHEN agent data is submitted THEN the system SHALL validate email format and mobile number format
3. WHEN agent creation is successful THEN the system SHALL save the agent to MongoDB and display success confirmation
4. WHEN duplicate email is entered THEN the system SHALL prevent creation and display error message
5. IF required fields are missing THEN the system SHALL display field-specific validation errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to upload CSV files containing contact lists, so that I can distribute tasks among available agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL accept only CSV, XLSX, and XLS formats
2. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate the presence of FirstName, Phone, and Notes columns
3. WHEN file validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages about format or structure issues
4. IF the uploaded file is empty or corrupted THEN the system SHALL reject the upload and notify the user
5. WHEN file processing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the parsed data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to automatically distribute uploaded contact lists equally among 5 agents, so that workload is balanced fairly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a validated CSV is processed THEN the system SHALL divide the total items by 5 agents equally
2. WHEN the total items are not divisible by 5 THEN the system SHALL distribute remaining items sequentially to agents
3. WHEN distribution is complete THEN the system SHALL save each agent's assigned list to MongoDB
4. WHEN distribution is successful THEN the system SHALL display the distribution summary showing items per agent
5. IF there are fewer than 5 agents in the system THEN the system SHALL distribute among available agents only

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to view the distributed lists for each agent, so that I can monitor task assignments and ensure proper distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all agents with their assigned item counts
2. WHEN clicking on an agent THEN the system SHALL show the detailed list of items assigned to that agent
3. WHEN displaying agent lists THEN the system SHALL show FirstName, Phone, and Notes for each item
4. WHEN no items are assigned to an agent THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message
5. IF the database connection fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and retry option

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity, so that users have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and display user-friendly messages
2. WHEN invalid data is submitted THEN the system SHALL provide specific validation feedback
3. WHEN file uploads exceed size limits THEN the system SHALL reject the upload with clear messaging
4. WHEN JWT tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically redirect to login page
5. IF the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log details and display generic error message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be easily configurable and deployable, so that setup and maintenance are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the application THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for database connection and JWT secret
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
3. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL include clear README instructions for setup and execution
4. WHEN running in development THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logging and debugging information
5. IF environment configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with setup guidance
